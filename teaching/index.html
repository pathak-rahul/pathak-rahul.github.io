<p class-"lead"> My primary teaching interests are in the area of public financial management, policy analysis and evaluation, and research methods. I am pursuing my Ph.D. in Public Policy with a focus on issues related to public finance and budgeting, so I am qualified to teach the related courses. I also have graduate training in Development Studies and have worked for over three years at research and academic institutions on issues related to social and urban policy. Thus, I can also teach courses related to economic development and social policy.
